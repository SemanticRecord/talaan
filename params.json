In addition, the library promotes sturctured, strongly-typed, semantic logging instead of the more common unstructured logging used in most projects.  Using semantic logging instead of unstructured logging helps your logs to be more easily consumed by tools such as Splunk.\r\n\r\nAn example of a typical unstructured log statement might look like the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nLogger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SampleLoggerInterface.class);\r\nString user = \"Rick Grimes\";\r\nLocalDate businessDate = LocalDate.of(2016, 7, 1);\r\nString company = \"Alexandria\";\r\nlogger.info(\"Looking up invoices for user {} on date {} in company {}\", \r\n             user, businessDate, company);\r\n// business logic to perform lookup\r\n```\r\nLogged output will look like the following:\r\n```console\r\n  INFO Looking up invoices for user Rick Grimes on date 2016-07-01 in company Alexandria\r\n```\r\n\r\nA semantic approach would make it more machine readable:\r\n```java\r\nlogger.info(\"event={}, user={}, businessDate={}, company={}\", \"lookupInvoices\", \r\n            user, businessDate, company);\r\n```\r\nOutput will be:\r\n```console\r\n  INFO event=lookupInvoices, user=Rick Grimes, businessDate=2016-07-01, company=Alexandria\r\n```\r\nThe preceding example makes logging statements consistent and easier to parse but we still end up with a bunch of strings scattered over our code base.  If we had an interface that we could call with strongly typed arguments then the logging statement and its parameters can be derived automatically.\r\n```java\r\npublic interface BusinessLogger { \r\n  void lookupInvoices(String user, LocalDate businessDate, String company);\r\n}\r\n\r\nBusinessLogger logger = SemanticLogger.getLogger(BusinessLogger.class);\r\nlogger.lookupInvoices(user, businessDate, company);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output will be the same as the preceding example.\r\n\r\nThe advantages you get from such an approach are the following:\r\n\r\n* Consistent formatting in log statements\r\n* Easier refactoring\r\n* Logging methods centralized into a single place\r\n* Find callers of the logging statement\r\n* Strong types help promote less defects\r\n* The possibility to mock the logging interface allows for fine-grained verification of the code\r\n",
